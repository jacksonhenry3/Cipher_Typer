  I built this website becouse I couldn't find a good looking morese code translator anywhere. You simply type in the textbox and as you type it is translated in to Morse code. The interesting part is that I used the <a href = 'https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html'> web audio API</a> to allow the user to listen to the morse code they have typed in by generating the sound on the fly using the broswer.

  If you are writing in morse code be sure not to use any special charachters or capitals, they are not ddefined in morese   and will result in all further output not working
