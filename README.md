I built this website becouse i couldn't find a good looking morese code translator anywhere. You simply type in the textbox and as you type it is translated in to Morse code.
The interesting part is that i used the web audio API to allow the user to listen to the morse code they have typed in by generating the sound on the fly using the broswer.
